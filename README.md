## Overview

This plugin helps you create and maintain a comprehensive German language learning system in Obsidian. It automatically generates structured entries for: Verbs, Nouns (with gender color-coding: ðŸ”µ masculine, ðŸ”´ feminine, ðŸŸ¢ neuter), Adjectives, and other parts of speech.

Once any form of a word appears in your text:
![Example Text with "du hast"](img/du_hast.png)

It and all of its other forms will be linked to its infinitive form:

The infinitive form points to all forms of the word, its antonyms, and synonyms:
