## Overview

This plugin helps you create and maintain a comprehensive German language learning system in Obsidian. It automatically generates structured entries for: Verbs, Nouns (with gender color-coding: ðŸ”µ masculine, ðŸ”´ feminine, ðŸŸ¢ neuter), Adjectives, and other parts of speech.

Once any form of a word appears in your text:
![Example Text with "du hast"](img/du_hast.png)

It and all of its other forms will be linked to its infinitive form:
![Past Participle Entry Example](img/gefragt.png)

The infinitive form points to all forms of the word, its antonyms, and synonyms:

## Network Use

This plugin utilizes network requests to communicate with the following remote services:

*   **Google Gemini API:** Used for translation, dictionary entry generation, and other language processing tasks.
*   **DeepSeek API:** Used as an alternative API provider for translation and language processing tasks.

These APIs require network access to function properly. The plugin sends text to these services for processing and receives the results back. Your API keys are stored securely within your Obsidian vault and are not shared with any third parties.

## API Keys

This plugin requires you to provide your own API keys for the Google Gemini API and/or the DeepSeek API. You can obtain these keys by creating accounts on the respective platforms.
